# Carbon for Vaadin 23
A theme for [Vaadin 23](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/) based on [IBM's Carbon](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/).

## Running the application

`mvn`

## Disclaimer
It's not perfect. Some of the differences between Carbon and Vaadin cannot be amended with CSS. There are also a few things I wasn't able to figure out based on Carbon's current documentation and source code.
